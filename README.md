 # GYM - Get Yourself Moving
 This is a website about a gym located in Dublin. The website is meant to outline key facts about the gym and encourage people to join the gym and get fit.
 
The website is a mobile first designed website using CSS, HTML5, Bootstrap & font awesome
 
## UX
External userâ€™s goal:
The site's users are people interested in finding out about GYM and signing up for membership. As a user I want to know why I should join the gym, what the gym offers and how to join. 

Site owner's goal:
To provide information about the gym and entice people to contact them and join.

## Features included:
 - A consistent navigation bar and footer throughout the website
 - A homepage that sells the main features of the gym and encourages user to join the gym
 - A second page with details of prices and how to join the gym
 - A third page with the class timetable
 - An about us page with key details about the gym.
 

## Features Left to Implement
In the about me section I would like to include a google map API rather than the map picture.
In the membership section I would like to have included a sign up form rather than the call to action by emailing the gym.



## Testing
All navigation links have been tested to ensure that they bring the user to the correct page. The design is responsive and so works on both desktop, tablet and mobile. 


## Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
