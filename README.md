 # GYM - Get Yourself Moving
 This is a website about a gym located in Dublin. The website is meant to outline key facts about the gym and encourage people to join the gym and get fit.
 
The website is a mobile first designed website using CSS, HTML5, Bootstrap & font awesome. 

The deployed website link is https://aoifemurfe.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/
 
## UX
External userâ€™s goal:
The site's users are people interested in finding out about GYM and signing up for membership. As a user I want to know why I should join the gym, what the gym offers and how to join. 

Site owner's goal:
To provide information about the gym and entice people to contact them and join. 

## Features included:
 - A consistent navigation bar and footer throughout the website
 - A homepage that sells the main features of the gym and encourages user to join the gym
 - A second page with details of prices and how to join the gym
 - A third page with the class timetable
 - An about us page with key details about the gym including a google map API. This page is also fully responsive and contains media queries. 
 

## Features Left to Implement:
- In the membership section I would like to have included a sign up form rather than the call to action by emailing the gym.
- A gallery or gym tour section to show more about what the gym offers. 


## Testing
All navigation links have been tested to ensure that they bring the user to the correct page. The design is responsive and so works on both desktop, tablet and mobile. 

I performed audits using the google lighthouse score tool and updated as per feedback. https://web.dev/ 


## Deployment
This project has been prepared on Git hub. The deployed version and the git hub version are the same.
